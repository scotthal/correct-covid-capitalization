External appearances suggest that it is the editorial policy of _The Washington
Post_ that the correct way to write, "COVID," is, "covid."

I respectfully disagree. This extension replaces incorrect capitalizations of
the word with correct capitalizations. At your option, it will instead use the
incorrect capitalization, "Covid." There is no option to retain _The Washington
Post's_ preferred capitalization.

As a bonus, this extension will correctly capitalize, "coronavirus," as,
"Coronavirus."

The extension only modifies content on the washingtonpost.com domain.
