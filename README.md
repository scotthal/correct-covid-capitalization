External appearances suggest that it is the editorial policy of _The Washington
Post_ that the correct way to write, "COVID," is, "covid."

I respectfully disagree.

As a bonus, this Chrome extension will correctly capitalize, "coronavirus," as,
"Coronavirus," when you're reading _Washington Post_ articles.
